Hello the internet. Thanks for visiting the site.

Life is a long journey, we come across new people, new technology and new problems everyday. As a person who sits in front of computer and dealing with software issues most time of the day, I found it very useful jotting down the challenges I run into and lessions learned while overcoming these challenges. It helps me review my thinking process and consolidate new knowledge learned.

With that being said, this site is mainly used as a journal. Hopefully the content I put down here will be useful for someone who run into a similar issue as well...
