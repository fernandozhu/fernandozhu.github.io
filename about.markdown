Hello the internet. Thanks for visiting the site.

Life is a long journey, we come across new people, new technology and new problems everyday. As a person who sits in front of computer and dealing with software issues most time of the day, I found it very useful jotting down the challenges I run into and lessions learned while overcoming these challenges. It helps review my thinking process and consolidate new knowledge learned.

With that being said, this site is mainly used as a learning journal. Hopefully the content I put down here will be useful for someone in the future as well...
